Types of variables in Java:
1) Local
2) Instance
3) Static

1) Local variables:
- Variables declares inside a block of code (method, loop, constructor, switch, etc)
- It uses always, because they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time in all the variables as soon as block of code is executed memory is free and can be used by other programs

2) Instance variables:
 - Those variables which are outside of block of code but inside a class without static keywords are called instance variables
 - It uses when we know that from object we will be having different values, and we might also need to share the variables between different instance methods of that class

3) Static variables:
- These instance variables that have static keyword with them are called static variables.
One single copy of variables is shared across all objects.
- It uses when we need to share something with all the objects, they mostly used as constants

We can also have instance and static methods but we can not use instance variable or methods directly inside a static method.
If we want to use them we must create an object of that class. But for instance methods we can freely use both type of methods and variables.

Access modification is done in Java with the help of three keyword:
1) private
2) protected
3) public
4) is not actually a keyword if we don't use any keywords with fields/methods default access is given to that field/method

1) Private is the most restricted one we can only access private fields or methods if we are inside the same class
