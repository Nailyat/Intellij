*** INSTANCE VARIABLES ***
Instance variables which are declared outside a method, loop, constructor or a block of code, but inside a class
w/o static keyword are called instance variables. We call them instatnce variables because for each object of that class
a new copy of the variables is created in memory.
We use an instance variables when a value is expected to change from object to object

*** STATIC VARIABLES ***
Instance variables with a static keyword are called static variables. They are called class level variables because
their value stays same across all the objects and only one memory location is occupied from the main memory.
We use a static variables when we have to share some data across all the objects or if data is same for all
the objects. Mostly this data used as constant. As a good practice we should access them using the class name.


*** LOCAL VARIABLES ***
Local variables which are declared inside a method, loop, switch case or any block of code.
We can not use static keyword with local variables. Local variablesoccupy the memory in computer for shortest period
of time.
