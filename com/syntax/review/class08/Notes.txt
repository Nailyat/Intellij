*** Access Modifiers in Java ***
1) Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods,
fields. constructors.
2) Keywords in Java to control the access of members of a class:
- private
- default
- protected
- public

*** Private:
We can only access that member inside that specific class
We can not have more than one public classes inside a Java file, there should be a public class with same name as
your file, otherwise you will get error.
We can have any classes in one file, but only one can be public.
In private class all the members having this access modifier can be accessed inside the same class only.

*** Default
Default access modifier is automatically applicable when we don't mention the same class and same package

*** Protected
Protected means all the members of a class are accessible within same class and package but if we need to
access them outside the package we need to extend from that class but to access something public

*** Public
Public means all the members are accessible throughout the project

============================================================================================
*** CONSTRUCTOR ***
Constructors are special block of code executed when we create the object of a class by writing
new keyword and name of class with parenthesis.
We mainly use constructor to initialize the fields of an object, but we can also put some code that we
want to execute everytime someone is creating the object of that class

Rules:
1) No return type not even void
2) Same name as class name
3) We can have constructors with and w/o parameters
4) Constructors don't participate in inheritance
5) Constructors are automatically called when you create the object
6) We can overload constructors (with different type and numbers of parameters)
7) We can't use non access modifiers like static with constructors
8) We can't override a constructor because they don't participate in inheritance
9) If we are not creating a constructor Java creates a default zero argument constructor automatically
