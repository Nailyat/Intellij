*** THIS keyword ***
We can use this keyword to differentiate between local and instance variables.
Use THIS() to refer to the constructors of the class if we have multiple constructors java will decide based on
the parameters which constructor to call.
THIS keyword calls the methods.

*** INHERITANCE ***
Inheritance is a mechanism in java wich we can access all the fields and methods from one class inside another class.
We use extends keyword to inherit thr properties and methods.
Advantages:
+ we can avoid code duplication;
+ it improves the performance;
+ it reduces the amount of memory required to run the program;
Disadvantages:
- parent(super class)/child(sub class) classes are tightly coupled if we make any changes we must          classes as well,
otherwise code may break

*** Types of Inheritance ***
1) Single inheritance - one single parent class and one single child class
2) Multilevel inheritance - we have chain of classes inheriting from each other (for example: class c->class b->class c)
3) Hierarchical inheritance - one parent class and multiple child classes
