Class Constructors and this keyword
Constructor is very similar to a method. Methods may or may not return something but constructor always never return anything, not even void
1) we use constructor to give initial values to feilds of class
2)constructors always have same name as class name while methods can have any names
Person{
String name;
String address;
int age;
String country;
Person(){
Syso("Inside the person class constructor this code will be executed automatically when we create  "
}
