*** SUPER Keyword ***

Super keyword is only applicable when we have at least two classes that have parent/child relationship.
If we have a duplicate field/method in parent and child class we can use super keyword to refer to the parent class
field/method. And if we do not use super keyword field/method from child class will be referred.
We can also ude super keyword with parentheses to call the parent class constructor
so that we do not repeat that code in all the child classes
